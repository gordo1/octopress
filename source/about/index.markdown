I'm Shane Gordon. I'm a Biochemist/Molecular Modeller, currently drumming away at a PhD at [La Trobe University](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/), Melbourne.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shane_Gordo), [GitHub](https://github.com/s-gordon), and [500px](https://500px.com/shaneegordon).

## Digital Photography

I shoot using a Canon EOS 1200D DSLR with either an EF-S 18-55 mm or EF 75-300 mm lens.

## 3D-printing

I'm using a [Flashforge Creator Dual Print Head 3D Printer](http://www.flashforge-usa.com/shop/3d-printers/creator-dual-extruder.html) for most of my 3D-printing needs, on temporary loan from a kindly colleague. A shameless clone of the Makerbot Replicator, it looks a little flimsy to the eye but gets the job done.

Depending on the purpose, most of my prints are done using either 0.15 or 0.3 mm layer slices in either [ABS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene#Applications) or (less commonly) [PLA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid#Applications).
